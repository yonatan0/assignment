My mindset was two standalone program.

Each ment to be execute on his own enviroment.

Backend- express, filesystem (for presist data), axios

Frontend- react, redux, axios, bootstrap(css), [reactreact-highlight-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-highlight-words), [react-paginate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate)

### Instructions

Backend

```sh
cd ./backend/
npm i
npm run dev
```

Frontend
The 'proxy' properity in the package.json is set for http://localhost:8000/ for simple use

```sh
cd ./frontend/

npm run start
```
